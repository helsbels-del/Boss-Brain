# **Boss Brain Challenge**

## **Introduction**

I have created a terminal-based code breaker game called Boss Brain Challenge, based on the original MasterMind board game that I loved playing in my younger years with my family and friends.
It has the same rules as the Mastermind game. The PC takes the place of the codemaker and teh player is the codebreaker. The codemaker generates a secret code of 4 colours, there are 6 colours to choose from. Then the codebreaker has to guess the secret code in a number of attempts. The number of attempts depends on the level selected. Level 1 is 12 attempts, level 2 is 10 attempts and level 3 is 8 attempts.

## **Target Audience**

The original Mastermind game is suitable for ages 8+. This version of the game would be suitable for 8+ also though the younger ages may require adult supervision. It is a great family game, as a board game, though this is more a one person game playing against the PC, though you could play alternate games against the PC as a family and keep score as you would in the original board games, where the winner is the person who guesses the secret code in the least attempts.
