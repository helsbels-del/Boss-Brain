# **Boss Brain Challenge**

## **Introduction**

I have created a terminal-based code breaker game called Boss Brain Challenge, based on the original MasterMind board game that I loved playing in my younger years with my family and friends.
It has the same rules as the Mastermind game. The PC takes the place of the codemaker and teh player is the codebreaker. The codemaker generates a secret code of 4 colours, there are 6 colours to choose from. Then the codebreaker has to guess the secret code in a number of attempts. The number of attempts depends on the level selected. Level 1 is 12 attempts, level 2 is 10 attempts and level 3 is 8 attempts.

## **Target Audience**

The original Mastermind game is suitable for ages 8+. This version of the game would be suitable for 8+ also though the younger ages may require adult supervision. It is a great family game, as a board game, though this is more a one person game playing against the PC, though you could play alternate games against the PC as a family and keep score as you would in the original board games, where the winner is the person who guesses the secret code in the least attempts.

## **User Requirements**

- The player wants to engage in a challenging game to solve a secret code to become a Boss Brain.
- The player wants the choice to read the instructions prior to playing the game.
- The player wants to access the game from the main menu and choose which level they would like to play.
- When playing the game, the player wants to have feedback to which of their colors are correct and how many are in the correct place.
- The player needs to know how many attempts they have left as they are playing.
- The player wants to know if they have been successful in guessing the correct code in the given amount of attempts.
- If the player does not guess the correct code in the given amount of attempts, then they want to know what the secret code is.
- The player will wont to exit the game after it has finished.
